                            <p>I strive to create exceptional experiences not only for end-users, but also for my colleagues and clients. By eliminating friction across teams, optimizing processes, and establishing practical systems, I actively contribute to the success of my team and the creation of world-class digital products.</p>
                            <p>I started my career as a front-end developer, building interfaces in React and CSS for my clients. After about a year, I discovered UX and quickly fell in love. Since then, I have been eagerly exploring every facet of the field. Over the past five years, I have evolved into a versatile senior designer, sharing my knowledge and guiding others along the way.</p>
                            <p>Today, my expertise spans a wide range of UX disciplines, with a focus on design systems, <a href="https://ooux.com/">Object-Oriented UX</a>, DesignOps, and connecting design and development teams.</p>
