            <h1>Real Time Payments API Portals
            </h1>
            <h2>Product Design of API Portal and Operations Portal</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The client requested assistance from Levvel in creating use cases
                and documenting the required functionality necessary to build a global RTP SaaS platform. Associated
                with this effort, Levvel was also tasked with documenting written requirements and the creation of
                high-fidelity mockups for both a Developer API Portal and a Management Portal.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Processing payments is both complicated and costly for businesses due to multiple systems, providers and
                standards. The client sought to build a centralized payments platform offering a one stop shop for cash
                management, invoicing, and payments, providing least cost routing of account to account transactions.
            </p>
            <p>The business-minded team at the client initially created the set of core features based on assumptions
                about what customers want and what competitors offer. Levvel was able to reframe the problem in a way
                that put the customer experience above all else. Our focus was on providing an application that
                customers would be delighted by and use. </p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>Levvel worked with key stakeholders to define the scope of the MVP product to be developed. This involved
                establishing key business drivers, assumptions and constraints to ensure buy-in from all key project
                members. This phase included multiple workshops, stakeholder interviews and brainstorming sessions
                designed to create alignment, collect knowledge, and generate new ideas for creating a comprehensive and
                differentiated product. My workstream consisted of two product designers, one API engineer, one Payments
                subject matter expert, and one engagement lead.

            <h5>Product Definition</h5>
            <p>On the first day of the workshop, Levvel reviewed all existing information and knowledge about the
                systems, the users and their problems. These exercises exposed assumptions, identified knowledge gaps,
                and aligned teams on project goals.
                <ol>
                    <li>Review business drivers/goals for the platform</li>
                    <li>Define pain points with the current platforms</li>
                    <li>Identify and define assumptions and constraints</li>
                    <li>Outline all user types and user flows</li>
                    <li>Survey current state architecture and technical standards, including desired security controls
                    </li>
                    <li>Document non-functional requirements for availability, fail-over, and TPS</li>
                    <li>Review requirements for regulatory controls, including both functionality and integrations</li>
                    <li>Understand future state technical standards</li>
                    <li>Identify, classify and align on high-level feature requirements and use cases for the platform
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>An additional workshop was held to clearly define and prioritize the high-level requirements required for
                MVP and to generate epics and associated user stories. Competitive analysis research informed much of
                the discussion in this second workshop. Participants identified the primary proto-personas the two
                portals would serve and produced high level user needs that would later translate into early
                requirements. After all of the workshops, the Levvel team created in-depth documentation of the desired
                functionality and prioritization of “must have'' features versus “nice to have'' features.</p>

            <p>Once we had determined the prioritized requirements list, there were about seven that both Levvel and the
                client agreed defined the minimum viable product. From there, Levvel’s product designers began the
                iterative process of designing prototypes and establishing a design system.
                Levvel’s product designers and business analyst collaborated with the stakeholders at the client through
                regular design reviews and requirement definition meetings. Each meeting gave the team further direction
                for the features of the new application.
            </p>
            <p>Project definition output included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Objectives and scope</li>
                    <li>Assumptions, constraints and limitations</li>
                    <li>Use cases</li>
                    <li>Roadmap / timeline</li>
                    <li>Competitive analysis research</li>
                    <li>Proto-personas</li>
                    <li>Prioritized user needs</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>Iterative Product Design</h5>
            <p>Building off the clarity gained from the Define phase, Levvel established the foundational aspects of the
                product solutions. After this foundational design was established, subsequent work began in an iterative
                format. Levvel worked with key client stakeholders, architects and SMEs to understand technology
                standards and preferences. Levvel evaluated alternatives and made technology recommendations and drove
                key solution decisions.</p>
            <p>We combined design thinking and technical expertise to shape business objectives into two online portals
                that solve real problems for real people. Through the following process, we worked alongside the client
                team to craft a solid product solution upon which the client could execute.
                <ol>
                    <li>Designers created high fidelity prototypes of particular features based on written requirements
                        provided by the Levvel architects and SMEs.</li>
                    <li>In daily meetings with major stakeholders, Levvel presented and reviewed the latest designs and
                        newest written requirements.</li>
                    <li>Considering the feedback from the stakeholders alongside the end user’s needs, the Levvel team
                        would modify and iterate on the feature until the stakeholders were satisfied.</li>
                    <li>Iterate and repeat the process again on the next feature or set of requirements.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>The stakeholders of this project requested to be included in every detail of the process. This meant
                reviewing and getting approval for every single decision from the smallest design element to the wording
                of every written requirement. This intense level of approval necessitated frequent check-ins, sometimes
                multiple times a day. All these review meetings coupled with very optimistic deadlines led to some
                strain on the team’s ability to manage time. On many occasions, all of the creative work of iterating on
                the prototypes or designing new features began late at night, after the day’s review meetings were
                complete. </p>
            <p>Project design output included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Synthesis deck of all the competitive analysis research</li>
                    <li>User personas and user flows for the most important features</li>
                    <li>High-fidelity mockups of MVP features for both the API Developer Portal and the API Operations
                        Portal</li>
                    <li>Detailed, clickable prototypes of the experience for each of the seven user personas</li>
                    <li>Design System assets for both a centralized light and dark theme that followed all brand
                        guidelines</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>In the end, we produced an organized document of detailed written requirements as well as high-fidelity
                clickable prototypes for two online portals. The developer portal was designed to provide documentation,
                training, and tools to consumer developers who implement the APIs. The management portal delivers
                detailed data and analysis on API operations and customer accounts, including usage and customer account
                information and management. The management portal enables the client to better serve their customers.
            </p>
            <p>After the engagement, the requirements document and the prototypes were handed over to the client so that
                they could initiate the development and deployment of these two portals. The level of detail we provided
                allowed the client’s developers to quickly digest the requirements and effectively produce functional
                products for end customers to utilize. </p>
