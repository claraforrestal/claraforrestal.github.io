            <h1>National Auto Insurance Provider</h1>
            <h2>Mobile Application for Managing Auto Insurance Policies</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p><img class="half-width" src="../assets/Client-Work/UI showcase - 2 mobile devices.png"
                    alt="Mobile Insurance Application">A national insurance provider partnered with Levvel to
                iteratively research and design a brand-new mobile
                application for its customers. The objective of this new app was to substantially improve end-user
                Customer Experience and to allow the client to increase its market position across its portfolio
                companies.</p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Based on their business objectives, the client identified both a timeline and a set of core application
                features prior to the engagement. Levvel was brought on with the goal of validating this initial set of
                features using customer research and user experience expertise. Through this iterative process, we
                identified and delivered designs for each of the most important features required for a minimum viable
                product.</p>
            <p>The business-minded team at the client initially created the set of core features based on assumptions
                about what customers want and what competitors offer. Levvel was able to reframe the problem in a way
                that put the customer experience above all else. Our focus was on providing an application that
                customers would be delighted by and use. </p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>The goal of Levvel’s engagement was to create the foundation artifacts required to support
                the creation of the MVP for the mobile application. This was broken up into three workstreams: research,
                product definition and visual design. The Levvel team consisted of 1 engagement manager, 2 researchers,
                2 product designers, 1 business analyst, and 1 Xamarin developer.
            </p>
            <h5>Product Definition</h5>
            <p>The product definition phase began with a two-day product workshop. Levvel planned and led activities
                that were designed to help the entire project team come to consensus on the goals and success metrics
                for the project. This workshop also included several brainstorming exercises that resulted in a
                consolidated, prioritized list of user needs to be addressed by this new mobile application.</p>
            <h5>Product Design</h5>
            <p>Once we had determined the prioritized requirements list, there were about seven that both Levvel and the
                client agreed defined the minimum viable product. From there, Levvel’s product designers began the
                iterative process of designing prototypes and establishing a design system.
                Levvel’s product designers and business analyst collaborated with the stakeholders at the client through
                regular design reviews and requirement definition meetings. Each meeting gave the team further direction
                for the features of the new application.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>The client received a comprehensive set of designs, requirements and code to start implementation. Once
                development of this application is complete, customers of the client will be able to manage their Direct
                Auto car insurance policies from any smartphone. Making payments, accessing roadside assistance, and
                reviewing coverages are just some of the tasks users can perform right from their phones. The solution
                puts the client in a competitive position among other auto insurance providers while also enabling the
                client to serve customers in a more modern and immediate fashion. </p>
