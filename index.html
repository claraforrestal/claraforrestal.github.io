                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Clara and I’m a product designer and a front end developer based in Charlotte, NC. I currently work as a Product Design Consultant at a software consultancy that specializes in end-to-end digital transformations for various clients. I’m passionate about creating and maintaining robust design systems that both designers and developers can utilize to improve processes.</p>
                <p>In many ways, I think of myself as a bridge between designers and front end developers. In my consulting work, I have worked in many roles depending on the client’s needs. I have developed and styled functional React and Angular components and pages. I have facilitated UX strategy workshops and user interviews in order to gather information on both the business problems and the user needs of a product. I have iteratively created low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity page designs resulting in elegant, clickable prototypes that clients love and developers utilize. </p>
                <p>Regardless of my role on a project, I consistently prioritize the product’s users. User research should be a core part of designing and developing solutions. Research findings coupled with a complete understanding of the business problem to be solved will ultimately result in world-class products.</p>
